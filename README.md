# WebOK

Just a stupid tool that checks a web URL constantly to see if I'm losing network.
My WiFi signal always show it's OK, but I never know if the router is OK. Hence this check.

Yes, I have a crappy connection, so it's useful to me.

When it can't connect to that URL, the systray icon displays that the network is down.
